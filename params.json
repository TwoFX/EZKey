If you are experiencing this issue, PLEASE send the following information to twofxsc@gmail.com**\r\n* OBS version that you are using, including 32/64 Bit\r\n* Windows version, 32/64 Bit\r\n* Is Windows Aero enabled or disabled while streaming?\r\n* Which version(s) of the .NET Framework is installed (see [this article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568.aspx) to find out how)?\r\n* Is StarCraft added as a software capture of game capture in OBS?\r\nThank you for providing feedback to fix the problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Work in progess\r\nThis is currently about as alpha as it gets. There are lots of awesome features to come and the program still has lots of problems.

I will put a detailed explaination about how to set it up and usde it here once I'm actually done coding it.\r\n\r\n### Setup guide for streamers\r\n1. Download the ZIP file on the left.\r\n2. Extract the ZIP.\r\n3. Run EZKey.exe from the Release folder.\r\n4. The application will open. Press the middle mouse button or click on options to bring up the options menu.\r\n5. Play around with the sliders until you find a configuration you like.\r\n6. The colors in the input fields can have the following formats (A=Alpha; R=Red; G=Green; B=Blue): #AARRGGBB or AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB or RRGGBB or #ARGB or ARGB or #RGB or RGB\r\n7. If you plan on chroma keying the background in order to put an image behind it later, I'd reccommend choosing #FFFF0000 as background color.\r\n8. Software capture it using OBS. If you want to chroma key, you will get the best result with a similarity value around 60.\r\n9. Don't attempt to minimize the software, just start StarCraft.\r\n10. If it doesn't work, please make sure to report you config as explained above. Thank you!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
